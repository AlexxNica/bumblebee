A fraction of their radiation can be reprocessed into the thermal nebular emission, seen in the spectrum from the near-UV to longer wavelengths. In the case of symbiotic X-ray binaries (SyXBs) a strong contribution from their cool giants is indicated in the optical/near-IR. In this paper I introduce a method of multiwavelength modelling the spectral energy distribution (SED) of SSSs from the supersoft X-rays to the near-IR with the aim to determine the physical parameters of their composite spectra. The method is demonstrated on two extragalactic SSSs, the SyXB RX J0059.1-7505 (LIN 358) in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), RX J0439.8-6809 in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and two Galactic SSSs, the classical nova RX J2030.5+5237 (V1974 Cyg) during its supersoft phase and the classical symbiotic star RX J1601.6+6648 (AG Dra) during its quiescent phase. The multiwavelength approach overcomes the problem of the mutual dependence between the temperature, luminosity and amount of absorption, which appears when only the X-ray data are fitted. Thus, the method provides an unambiguous solution. It was found that selection of the model (a blackbody or an atmospheric model) is not of crucial importance in fitting the global X-ray/IR SED. The multiwavelength modelling of the SED of SSSs is essential in determining their physical parameters.","links_data":["{\"title\":\"\", \"type\":\"preprint\", \"instances\":\"\", \"access\":\"open\"}","{\"title\":\"\", \"type\":\"electr\", \"instances\":\"\", \"access\":\"\"}"],"id":"2085813","bibcode":"2015NewA...36..116S","pubdate":"2015-04-00","aff":["Astronomical Institute, Slovak Academy of Sciences, 059 60 Tatranská Lomnica, Slovakia; >Visiting Astronomer: Astronomical Institut, Bamberg"],"email":["-"],"pub":"New Astronomy","volume":"36","keyword":["Stars: fundamental parameters","Stars: binaries: symbiotic","X-rays: binaries","Astrophysics - Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"author":["Skopal, A."],"title":["Multiwavelength modelling the SED of supersoft X-ray sources I.

During the SSS phase, the model SEDs revealed the presence of a strong stellar and nebular component of radiation in the spectrum. The former was emitted by the burning WD at highly super-Eddington rate, while the latter represented a fraction of its radiation reprocessed by the thermal nebula. During the transition phase, both the components were decreasing and during quiescence the SED satisfied radiation produced by a large, optically thick disk (R<SUB>disk</SUB> > 10  R<SUB>☉</SUB>). The super-Eddington luminosity of the burning WD during the SSS phase was independently justified by the high quantity of the nebular emission. The emitting material surrounded the burning WD, and its mass was (1.6 ± 0.5) ×10<SUP>-4</SUP><SUP>(d / 1.6kpc) 5 / 2</SUP>  M<SUB>☉</SUB> . The helium ash, deposited on the WD surface during the whole burning period, was around of 8 ×10<SUP>-6</SUP><SUP>(d / 1.6kpc) 2</SUP> M<SUB>☉</SUB> , which yields an average growing rate of the WD mass, M<SUB>̇WD</SUB> ∼ 4 ×10<SUP>-7</SUP><SUP>(d / 1.6kpc) 2</SUP>  M<SUB>☉</SUB>yr<SUP>-1</SUP> .

During quiescence, the accretion rate from the model SED of ∼ 2.3 ×10<SUP>-7</SUP> M<SUB>☉</SUB>yr<SUP>-1</SUP> requires a super-Eddington accretion from the disk at ∼ 3.6 ×10<SUP>-5</SUP> M<SUB>☉</SUB>yr<SUP>-1</SUP> during the outburst. Such a high accretion can be responsible for the super-Eddington luminosity during the whole burning phase. Simultaneous presence of jets supports this scenario. If the wind from the giant is not sufficient to feed the WD at the required rate, the accretion can be realized from the disk-like reservoir of material around the WD. In this case the time between outbursts will extend, with the next explosion beyond 2027. In the opposite case, the wind from the giant has to be focused to the orbital plane to sustain the high accretion rate at a few ×10<SUP>-7</SUP> M<SUB>☉</SUB>yr<SUP>-1</SUP> .

Due to its large field-of-view, more than 90% duty cycle and sensitivity up to 100 TeV gamma rays, the Milagro observatory is well suited to perform a search for PBH bursts. Based on a search on the Milagro data, we report new PBH burst rate density upper limits over a range of PBH observation times.

These minerals hint of the aqueous history of Noachian time on Mars.

Dust-storm days (356 in total) are associated with visibility below 1 km at Zabol, Iran meteorological station with higher frequency and intensity in June and July.

HYSPLIT forward-trajectory analysis at 500 m for air masses originated from Sistan on the dust-storm days shows that they usually follow an anti-clockwise transport direction at elevations usually below 2 km, initially moving southwards and then shifting to east-northeast when they are approaching the Arabian Sea coast. This is the result of the influence of the local topography and formation of thermal low-pressure systems over the arid lands. It is found that in few cases the dust storms from Sistan affect central/south Arabian Sea and India, while they control the aerosol loading over northernmost Arabian Sea. The Infrared Difference Dust Index (IDDI) images, which represent brightness temperature reduction due to dust presence over land, are used at specific periods of persistent dust storms over Sistan, confirming the main pathways of the dust plumes and illustrating the importance of the region as one of the most active dust sources in southwest Asia.","links_data":["{\"title\":\"\", \"type\":\"electr\", \"instances\":\"\", \"access\":\"\"}"],"pub":"Aeolian Research","volume":"16","email":["-","-","-","-","-"],"bibcode":"2015AeoRe..16...35R","id":"10663815","pubdate":"2015-03-00","keyword":["Dust storm","Remote sensing","Transport pathways","IDDI","Sistan","Arabian Sea"],"author":["Rashki, A.","Kaskaoutis, D.

The Lushan earthquake resulted in the deformation of the Sichuan basin and the Longmenshan ranges in proximity to the LFZ. The line of sight (LOS) displacement values obtained from DInSAR technique mainly range between -4.0 cm to +3.0 cm. The western Sichuan basin shows oblique westward movement with predominant downward component in areas farther from LFZ and predominant westward component over the downward movement in areas closer to the source fault. Inversion modelling has been used to derive the seismic source characteristics from DInSAR derived deformation values using elastic dislocation source type. The linear inversion model converged at a double-fault source solution consisting of a deeper, steep, NW dipping fault plane-1 of 60 km × 16 km dimension and a shallower, gentle, NW dipping fault plane-2 of 60 km × 15 km dimension, with distributed slip values varying between 0 to 2.26 m. These fault planes (fault planes-1 and -2) coincide with the Dachuan-Shuangshi fault and the buried Range Front Fault, respectively. The inversion model gives a moment magnitude of 6.81 and the geodetic moment of 2.07 × 10<SUP>19</SUP> Nm, comparable to those given in literature, derived using teleseismic body wave data. Thus DInSAR technique helped to quantify the co-seismic deformation and to retrieve the source characteristics from the estimated deformation values.

Hence, leaf area index (LAI) stays high even when chlorophyll content degrades to zero. Current LAI approaches from remote sensing techniques are not optimized for estimating LAI of senescent vegetation. In this paper a two-step approach has been proposed to realize simultaneous LAI mapping over green and senescent croplands. The first step separates green from brown LAI by means of a newly proposed index, 'Green Brown Vegetation Index (GBVI)'. This index exploits two shortwave infrared (SWIR) spectral bands centred at 2100 and 2000 nm, which fall right in the dry matter absorption regions, thereby providing positive values for senescent vegetation and negative for green vegetation. The second step involves applying linear regression functions based on optimized vegetation indices to estimate green and brown LAI estimation respectively. While the green LAI index uses a band in the red and a band in the red-edge, the brown LAI index uses bands located in the same spectral region as GBVI, i.e. an absorption band located in the region of maximum absorption of cellulose and lignin at 2154 nm, and a reference band at 1635 nm where the absorption of both water and dry matter is low. The two-step approach was applied to a HyMap image acquired over an agroecosystem at the agricultural site Barrax, Spain.","links_data":["{\"title\":\"\", \"type\":\"electr\", \"instances\":\"\", \"access\":\"\"}"],"pub":"International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation","volume":"35","email":["-","-","-","-","-"],"bibcode":"2015IJAEO..35..350D","id":"10664681","pubdate":"2015-03-00","keyword":["Brown LAI","Vegetation indices","Hyperspectral","Agroecosystem","Senescent vegetation","Sentinel-2"],"author":["Delegido, Jesús","Verrelst, Jochem","Rivera, Juan P.","Ruiz-Verdú, Antonio","Moreno, José"],"aff":["Laboratorio de Procesamiento de Imágenes, Universidad de Valencia, C/Catedrático José Beltrán, 2, 46980 Paterna (Valencia), Spain","Laboratorio de Procesamiento de Imágenes, Universidad de Valencia, C/Catedrático José Beltrán, 2, 46980 Paterna (Valencia), Spain","Laboratorio de Procesamiento de Imágenes, Universidad de Valencia, C/Catedrático José Beltrán, 2, 46980 Paterna (Valencia), Spain","Laboratorio de Procesamiento de Imágenes, Universidad de Valencia, C/Catedrático José Beltrán, 2, 46980 Paterna (Valencia), Spain","Laboratorio de Procesamiento de Imágenes, Universidad de Valencia, C/Catedrático José Beltrán, 2, 46980 Paterna (Valencia), Spain"],"title":["Brown and green LAI mapping through spectral indices"],"[citations]":{"num_citations":0,"num_references":10}},{"abstract":"The boundary between Earth's crust and mantle is commonly modelled as a discontinuity surface, the so-called Moho. Although in some regions of the world this model may be too approximate or even unrealistic, globally speaking it can provide a key to read several long wavelength geophysical signals. Recent research activities have shown the possibility to estimate the Moho discontinuity worldwide from global gravity field model, however usually the solution of this inverse problem requires strong unrealistic hypotheses.In this work a new procedure to relax some of these unrealistic hypotheses is devised and described in details. Basically it allows to estimate the mean Moho depth even once the normal gravitational field is removed if at least one seismic observation is available, to take into account the dependency of the crust density on the radial direction (usually neglected in Moho depth determination from gravity), to correct the a-priori density model of the crystalline crust for scale factors again using seismic information and finally to consider a Moho with a non-constant depth as reference surface in the inversion, thus reducing the linearization error.The new procedure is here applied to GOCE data to estimate a new crustal model. For this purpose additional external information has been used, such as topography, bathymetry and ice sheet models from ETOPO1, a recent 1° × 1° sediment global model and some prior hypotheses on crustal density. In particular the main geological provinces, each of them characterized by its own relation between density and depth, have been considered. A model describing lateral density variations of the upper mantle is also taken into account.The new crustal model is computed at a spatial resolution of 0.5° × 0.5°, its gravitational effect differs from GOCE observations of 49 mE and its Moho depth error standard deviation is globally of 3.4 km. Therefore the result seems to be an improvement in terms of resolution, consistency with the gravity field and accuracy not only with respect to previously released GEMMA models, but also with respect to the current state-of-the-art global knowledge of the Earth crust.","links_data":["{\"title\":\"\", \"type\":\"electr\", \"instances\":\"\", \"access\":\"\"}"],"pub":"International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation","volume":"35","email":["-","-"],"bibcode":"2015IJAEO..35...31R","id":"9116926","pubdate":"2015-03-00","author":["Reguzzoni, M.","Sampietro, D."],"aff":["DICA - Politecnico di Milano, Piazza Leonardo da Vinci 32, 20133 Milano, Italy","GReD s.r.l., Via Valleggio 11, 22100 Como, Italy"],"title":["GEMMA: An Earth crustal model based on GOCE satellite data"],"[citations]":{"num_citations":2,"num_references":15}},{"abstract":"The GOCE (Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer) mission, launched on March 2009, included a new type of satellite instrument, an on-board three-axis gradiometer able to measure the Earth's gravity gradients at the satellite height (255 km). The potential of this new type of measurement and its derived products (i.e., global gravity field models), together with other land-based geophysical observables (Bouguer and geoid anomalies), to image sub-lithospheric thermal and compositional anomalies is evaluated in this study. We focus on the Atlantic-Mediterranean Transition Region (AMTR), the diffuse, transpressive contact between the Iberian Peninsula and North Africa. The present-day lithospheric structure in the area is characterized by a wide band of active deformation, large lateral variations in the lithosphere and the presence of a positive seismic-velocity anomaly in the uppermost mantle beneath the Betics and the westernmost Alboran Basin-Gibraltar Arc. Here, the perturbing effects of deep, sub-lithospheric density anomalies in GOCE gravity gradients and other land-based geophysical data are assessed, and its impact in lithospheric-scale geophysical-petrological modeling within a thermodynamically consistent framework analyzed. Some of the gravity gradients computed at the satellite altitude are rather sensitive to the presence of even a relatively small sub-lithospheric cold slab, like the one observed in the AMTR, showing the potential of the new GOCE data to map upper mantle anomalies. Lithospheric models ignoring the AMTR sub-lithospheric heterogeneities could be significantly biased. In particular, extreme changes of 4-6 km and 60-70 km in the crustal and lithospheric thickness, respectively, are required to include sub-lithospheric mantle contributions to land-based and satellite gravity data.","links_data":["{\"title\":\"\", \"type\":\"electr\", \"instances\":\"\", \"access\":\"\"}"],"pub":"International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation","volume":"35","email":["-","-","-","-","-","-"],"bibcode":"2015IJAEO..35...54F","id":"9116886","pubdate":"2015-03-00","author":["Fullea, J.","Rodríguez-González, J.","Charco, M.","Martinec, Z.","Negredo, A.","Villaseñor, A."],"aff":["Institute of Geosciences, (CSIC, UCM), ES-28040 Madrid, Spain","Institute of Geosciences, (CSIC, UCM), ES-28040 Madrid, Spain","Institute of Geosciences, (CSIC, UCM), ES-28040 Madrid, Spain","Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies, 5 Merrion Square, Dublin 2, Ireland","Institute of Geosciences, (CSIC, UCM), ES-28040 Madrid, Spain","Institute of Earth Sciences “Jaume Almera”, ICTJA-CSIC, ES-08028 Barcelona, Spain"],"title":["Perturbing effects of sub-lithospheric mass anomalies in GOCE gravity gradient and other gravity data modelling: Application to the Atlantic-Mediterranean transition zone"],"[citations]":{"num_citations":3,"num_references":45}},{"abstract":"We aim to interpret the vertical gravity and vertical gravity gradient of the GOCE-GRACE combined gravity model over the southeastern part of the Congo basin to refine the published model of sedimentary rock cover. We use the GOCO03S gravity model and evaluate its spherical harmonic representation at or near the Earth's surface. In this case, the gradiometry signals are enhanced as compared to the original measured GOCE gradients at satellite height and better emphasize the spatial pattern of sedimentary geology.To avoid aliasing, the omission error of the modelled gravity induced by the sedimentary rocks is adjusted to that of the GOCO03S gravity model. The mass-density Green's functions derived for the a priori structure of the sediments show a slightly greater sensitivity to the GOCO03S vertical gravity gradient than to the vertical gravity. Hence, the refinement of the sedimentary model is carried out for the vertical gravity gradient over the basin, such that a few anomalous values of the GOCO03S-derived vertical gravity gradient are adjusted by refining the model. We apply the 5-parameter Helmert's transformation, defined by 2 translations, 1 rotation and 2 scale parameters that are searched for by the steepest descent method.The refined sedimentary model is only slightly changed with respect to the original map, but it significantly improves the fit of the vertical gravity and vertical gravity gradient over the basin. However, there are still spatial features in the gravity and gradiometric data that remain unfitted by the refined model. These may be due to lateral density variation that is not contained in the model, a density contrast at the Moho discontinuity, lithospheric density stratifications or mantle convection.In a second step, the refined sedimentary model is used to find the vertical density stratification of sedimentary rocks. Although the gravity data can be interpreted by a constant sedimentary density, such a model does not correspond to the gravitational compaction of sedimentary rocks. Therefore, the density model is extended by including a linear increase in density with depth. Subsequent L<SUB>2</SUB> and L<SUB>∞</SUB> norm minimization procedures are applied to find the density parameters by adjusting both the vertical gravity and the vertical gravity gradient.We found that including the vertical gravity gradient in the interpretation of the GOCO03S-derived data reduces the non-uniqueness of the inverse gradiometric problem for density determination. The density structure of the sedimentary formations that provide the optimum predictions of the GOCO03S-derived gravity and vertical gradient of gravity consists of a surface density contrast with respect to surrounding rocks of 0.24-0.28 g/cm<SUP>3</SUP> and its decrease with depth of 0.05-0.25 g/cm<SUP>3</SUP> per 10 km. Moreover, the case where the sedimentary rocks are gravitationally completely compacted in the deepest parts of the basin is supported by L<SUB>∞</SUB> norm minimization.

It is, however, necessary to isolate the near-surface geologic signal from the contributions of thickness variations in the crust and lithosphere and the isostatic compensation of surface relief. Here Africa is studied with particular emphasis on selected geological features which are expected to appear as density inhomogeneities. These include cratons and fold belts in the Precambrian basement, the overlying sedimentary basins and magmatism, as well as the continental margins. Regression analysis between gravity and topography shows coefficients that are consistently positive for the free air gravity anomaly and negative for the Bouguer gravity anomaly. The error and scatter on the regression are smallest in oceanic areas, where it is a possible tool for identifying changes in crustal type. The regression analysis allows the large gradient in the Bouguer anomaly signal across continental margins to be removed. After subtracting the predicted effect of known topography from the original Bouguer anomaly field, the residual field shows a continent-wide pattern of anomalies that could be attributed to regional geological structures. A few of these are highlighted, such as those representing Karoo magmatism, the Kibalian foldbelt, the Zimbabwe Craton, the Cameroon and Tibesti volcanic deposits, the Benue Trough and the Luangwa Rift. A reconstruction of the pre-break up position of Africa and South America (the plates forming West Gondwana) is made for the residual GOCE gravity field. The reconstruction allows the positive and negative anomalies to be compared across the continental fragments, and so helps identify common geologic units that extend across both the now-separate continents.","links_data":["{\"title\":\"\", \"type\":\"electr\", \"instances\":\"\", \"access\":\"\"}"],"pub":"International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation","volume":"35","email":["-"],"bibcode":"2015IJAEO..35...88B","id":"9116936","pubdate":"2015-03-00","author":["Braitenberg, Carla"],"aff":["Department of Mathematics and Geosciences, University of Trieste, Trieste, Italy"],"title":["Exploration of tectonic structures with GOCE in Africa and across-continents"],"[citations]":{"num_citations":3,"num_references":25}},{"abstract":"The gravity field and derivatives generated with the high resolution EIGEN-6C2 gravity model which includes satellite gravity data of GOCE (Gravity field and steady-state Ocean Circulation Explorer) has been utilized for geological appraisal of the Singhbhum-Orissa Craton, India.

Here we use GOCE to measure surface current speeds in the North Atlantic and compare our results with a range of independent estimates that use drifter data to improve small scales. We find that, with filtering, GOCE can recover 70% of the Gulf Steam strength relative to the best drifter-based estimates. In the subpolar gyre the boundary currents obtained from GOCE are close to the drifter-based estimates. Crucial to this result is careful filtering which is required to remove small-scale errors, or noise, in the computed surface. We show that our heuristic noise metric, used to determine the degree of filtering, compares well with the quadratic sum of mean sea surface and formal geoid errors obtained from the error variance-covariance matrix associated with the GOCE gravity model. At a resolution of 100 km the North Atlantic mean GOCE MDT error before filtering is 5 cm with almost all of this coming from the GOCE gravity model.","links_data":["{\"title\":\"\", \"type\":\"electr\", \"instances\":\"\", \"access\":\"\"}"],"pub":"International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation","volume":"35","email":["-","-","-"],"bibcode":"2015IJAEO..35..140B","id":"9117198","pubdate":"2015-03-00","author":["Bingham, Rory J.","Haines, Keith","Lea, Daniel", "fake1", "fake2"],"aff":["School of Geographical Sciences, University of Bristol, Bristol BS8 1SS, United Kingdom","University of Reading, Reading RG6 6AH, United Kingdom","Met Office, Exeter EX1 3PB, United Kingdom"],"title":["A comparison of GOCE and drifter-based estimates of the North Atlantic steady-state surface circulation"],"[citations]":{"num_citations":3,"num_references":19}},{"abstract":"Wetlands are among Earth's most dynamic, diverse and varied habitats as the balance between land and water surfaces provide shelter to a unique mixture of plant and animal species. This study explores the changes in two Mediterranean wetland delta environments formed by the Axios and Aliakmonas rivers located in Greece, over a 25-year period (1984-2009). Direct photo-interpretation of four Landsat TM images acquired during the study period was performed. Furthermore, a sophisticated, semi-automatic image classification method based on support vector machines (SVMs) was developed to streamline the mapping process. Deposition and erosion magnitudes at different temporal scales during the study period were quantified using both approaches based on coastline surface area changes. Analysis using both methods was conducted in a geographical information systems (GIS) environment.Direct photo-interpretation, which formed our reference dataset, showed noticeable changes in the coastline deltas of both study areas, with erosion occurring mostly in the earlier periods (1990-2003) in both river deltas followed by deposition in more recent years (2003-2009), but at different magnitudes. Spatial patterns of coastline changes predicted from the SVMs showed similar trends. In absolute terms SVMs predictions of sediment erosion and deposition in the studied area were different in the order of 5-20% in comparison to photo-interpretation, evidencing the potential capability of this method in coastline changes monitoring. One of the main contributions of our work lies to the use of the SVMs classifier in coastal mapping of changes, since to our knowledge use of this technique has been under-explored in this application domain. Furthermore, this study provides important contribution to the understanding of Mediterranean river delta dynamics and their behaviours, and corroborates the usefulness of EO technology and GIS as an effective tool in policy decision making and successful landscape management. The latter is of considerable scientific and practical value to the wider community of interested users, given the continued open access to observations from this satellite radiometer globally.","links_data":["{\"title\":\"\", \"type\":\"electr\", \"instances\":\"\", \"access\":\"\"}"],"pub":"International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation","volume":"35","email":["-","-","-","-"],"bibcode":"2015IJAEO..35..217P","id":"9117269","pubdate":"2015-03-00","keyword":["Remote sensing","GIS","Landsat TM","Coastline mapping","Photo-interpretation","Support vector machines"],"author":["Petropoulos, George P.","Kalivas, Dionissios P.","Griffiths, Hywel M.","Dimou, Paraskevi P."],"aff":["Department of Geography and Earth Sciences, Penglais Campus, Aberystwyth, Aberystwyth University, SY23 3DB, United Kingdom","Department of Natural Resources Management & Agricultural Engineering, Agricultural University of Athens, 75 Iera Odos, 118 55 Athens, Greece","Department of Geography and Earth Sciences, Penglais Campus, Aberystwyth, Aberystwyth University, SY23 3DB, United Kingdom","Department of Natural Resources Management & Agricultural Engineering, Agricultural University of Athens, 75 Iera Odos, 118 55 Athens, Greece"],"title":["Remote sensing and GIS analysis for mapping spatio-temporal changes of erosion and deposition of two Mediterranean river deltas: The case of the Axios and Aliakmonas rivers, Greece"],"[citations]":{"num_citations":0,"num_references":31}},{"abstract":"Until recently, land surveys and digital interpretation of remotely sensed imagery have been used to generate land use inventories. These techniques however, are often cumbersome and costly, allocating large amounts of technical and temporal costs. The technological advances of web 2.0 have brought a wide array of technological achievements, stimulating the participatory role in collaborative and crowd sourced mapping products. This has been fostered by GPS-enabled devices, and accessible tools that enable visual interpretation of high resolution satellite images/air photos provided in collaborative mapping projects. Such technologies offer an integrative approach to geography by means of promoting public participation and allowing accurate assessment and classification of land use as well as geographical features. OpenStreetMap (OSM) has supported the evolution of such techniques, contributing to the existence of a large inventory of spatial land use information. This paper explores the introduction of this novel participatory phenomenon for land use classification in Europe's metropolitan regions. We adopt a positivistic approach to assess comparatively the accuracy of these contributions of OSM for land use classifications in seven large European metropolitan regions. Thematic accuracy and degree of completeness of OSM data was compared to available Global Monitoring for Environment and Security Urban Atlas (GMESUA) datasets for the chosen metropolises. We further extend our findings of land use within a novel framework for geography, justifying that volunteered geographic information (VGI) sources are of great benefit for land use mapping depending on location and degree of VGI dynamism and offer a great alternative to traditional mapping techniques for metropolitan regions throughout Europe. Evaluation of several land use types at the local level suggests that a number of OSM classes (such as anthropogenic land use, agricultural and some natural environment classes) are viable alternatives for land use classification. These classes are highly accurate and can be integrated into planning decisions for stakeholders and policymakers.","links_data":["{\"title\":\"\", \"type\":\"electr\", \"instances\":\"\", \"access\":\"\"}"],"pub":"International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation","volume":"35","email":["-","-"],"bibcode":"2015IJAEO..35..329J","id":"9117199","pubdate":"2015-03-00","keyword":["Land use mapping","Comparative assessment","GMESUA","OpenStreetMap","Collaborative mapping","Citizen science"],"author":["Jokar Arsanjani, Jamal","Vaz, Eric"],"aff":["Heidelberg University, Institute of Geography, GIScience Research Group, Heidelberg, Germany","Ryerson University, Department of Geography, Toronto, ON, Canada"],"title":["An assessment of a collaborative mapping approach for exploring land use patterns for several European metropolises"],"[citations]":{"num_citations":0,"num_references":9}},{"abstract":"FeCoNi nanowire arrays (175 nm in diameter and lengths ranging from 5 to 40 μm) were fabricated into nanopores of hard-anodized aluminum oxide templates using pulsed ac electrodeposition technique. Increasing the length had no considerable effect on the composition and crystalline characteristics of Fe<SUB>47</SUB>Co<SUB>38</SUB>Ni<SUB>15</SUB> nanowires (NWs). By eliminating the dendrites formed at the bottom of the pores, we report a careful investigation on the effect of magnetostatic interactions on magnetic properties and the effect of nanowire length on reversal modes. Hysteresis loop measurements indicated that increasing the length decreases coercivity and squareness values. On the other hand, first-order reversal curve measurements show a linear correlation between the magnetostatic interactions and length of NWs. Comparing reversal modes of the NWs both experimentally and theoretically using angular dependence of coercivity, we find that when L≤22 μm, a vortex domain wall mode is only occurred. When L>22 μm, a non-monotonic behavior indicates a transition from the vortex to transverse domain wall propagation. As a result, a critical length was found above which the transition between the reversal modes is occurred due the enhanced interactions. The transition angle also shifts toward a lower angle as the length increases. Moreover, with increasing length from 22 to 31 μm, the single domain structure of NWs changes to a pseudo single domain state. A multidomain-like behavior is also found for the longest NWs length.","links_data":["{\"title\":\"\", \"type\":\"electr\", \"instances\":\"\", \"access\":\"\"}"],"pub":"Journal of Magnetism and Magnetic Materials","volume":"378","email":["-","-","-","-"],"bibcode":"2015JMMM..378...73S","id":"10664956","pubdate":"2015-03-00","keyword":["FeCoNi nanowires","FORC diagrams","Magnetostatic interactions","Reversal modes"],"author":["Samanifar, S.","Almasi Kashi, M.","Ramazani, A.","Alikhani, M."],"aff":["Department of Physics, University of Kashan, Kashan, 87317-51167, Iran","Department of Physics, University of Kashan, Kashan, 87317-51167, Iran","Department of Physics, University of Kashan, Kashan, 87317-51167, Iran","Department of Physics, University of Kashan, Kashan, 87317-51167, Iran"],"title":["Reversal modes in FeCoNi nanowire arrays: Correlation between magnetostatic interactions and nanowires length"],"[citations]":{"num_citations":0,"num_references":41}},{"abstract":"In the Fe<SUP>3+</SUP> doped wide-gap oxide of β-Ga<SUB>2-x</SUB>Fe<SUB>x</SUB>O<SUB>3</SUB> (x=0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4), Rietveld refinements of the X-ray diffraction data show that the Fe<SUP>3+</SUP> ions are preferentially occupied on the octahedral sites.

As it turned out polar night thunderstorms occur most often in situations with southern warm marine air advections intensified by the positive North Atlantic and Arctic Oscillations. Thunderstorms in this season are characterized by steep vertical lapse rates and occur most likely at the cold fronts. Polar day thunderstorms form when warm air masses move from the continental north-eastern Europe to the Arctic, and create unstable conditions. In this type, thunderstorms are generated by elevated convection and occur most likely in a cyclone's cool side of warm sector.","links_data":["{\"title\":\"\", \"type\":\"electr\", \"instances\":\"\", \"access\":\"\"}"],"pub":"Atmospheric Research","volume":"154","email":["-","-","-","-"],"bibcode":"2015AtmRe.154...60C","id":"10664040","pubdate":"2015-03-00","keyword":["<ce:text id=\"tx0010\">Thunderstorm","<ce:text id=\"tx0015\">Arctic","<ce:text id=\"tx0020\">Atmospheric circulation"],"author":["Czernecki, Bartosz","Taszarek, Mateusz","Kolendowicz, Leszek","Szyga-Pluta, Katarzyna"],"aff":["Department of Climatology, Institute of Physical Geography and Environmental Planning, Adam Mickiewicz University, Dzięgielowa 27, 61-680 Poznań, Poland","Department of Climatology, Institute of Physical Geography and Environmental Planning, Adam Mickiewicz University, Dzięgielowa 27, 61-680 Poznań, Poland","Department of Climatology, Institute of Physical Geography and Environmental Planning, Adam Mickiewicz University, Dzięgielowa 27, 61-680 Poznań, Poland","Department of Climatology, Institute of Physical Geography and Environmental Planning, Adam Mickiewicz University, Dzięgielowa 27, 61-680 Poznań, Poland"],"title":["Atmospheric conditions of thunderstorms in the European part of the Arctic derived from sounding and reanalysis data"],"[citations]":{"num_citations":0,"num_references":20}}]},"highlighting":{"10664088":{"body":[" have studied the interaction between vector mesons and octet baryons using a uni-<em>tary</em> framework in coupled"]},"2085841":{},"2085813":{"body":[" Catalogue of Emission-Line Stars and <em>Planetary</em> Nebulae in the Small Magellanic Cloud by Lindsay, 1961 under"]},"2085852":{},"2084445":{},"10686877":{"abstract":[" to provide water in terrestrial <em>planets.</em> Primitive meteorites show a wide range of porosity"]},"10686878":{"abstract":[" of these mineral assemblages on Mars, which may help in understanding the evolutionary history of the <em>planet.</em>"]},"2084429":{"body":[" galaxies, stars, <em>planets,</em> and people.
